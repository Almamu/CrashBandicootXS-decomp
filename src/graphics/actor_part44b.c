/* A `gStaticData_0817C1C0` stride-8 trampoline-record dispatcher -
 * exactly the same shape as `sub_802C208`
 * (src/graphics/actor_part19e.c, issue #52): `{s16 baseOff; s16 count;
 * s16 subOffset}` records, indexed by `self+0x28`'s state; when
 * `count > 0`, indexes a per-instance list pointer at
 * `self+subOffset` and reads its last entry's `{s32 delta; void *fn}`
 * pair, added to `baseOff` for the trampoline address; otherwise falls
 * back to the record's own inline `{..; void *fn}` pair at `+4` with
 * just `baseOff` for the address. Fires
 * `sub_803AD84(self+addr, baseOff, count, fn)`.
 *
 * Transcribed as NAKED asm for the same reason as `sub_802C208`: the
 * ROM keeps `gStaticData_0817C1C0`'s base address alive in `r7` for
 * the whole function, and this compiler's r7 hazard (see
 * `sub_802C208`'s comment and docs/matching.md's `sub_8007DBC`/
 * `sub_8006600` entries) makes that unreachable from plain C. */
